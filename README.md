Assignment: Project 2: Document Classification
Date: April 28, 2017

Description: In this project, we attempt to find ways to classify documents by parsing their input and using patterns to group them. We explore six different initial
strategies in order to test and evaluate our classification process. By comparing these strategies, their weak points and strong points will surface, allowing us to
determine the best scenarios for each strategy. Our writeup will lay out the details for interested recipients.

How to build/run:

Type "python3 main.py 'training_dir_1' 'training_dir_2' 'training_dir_3' 'testing_dir'" (Note: The single quotes are optional)
Where each 'training_dir' represents a relative path to a directory used for training the algorithms and 'testing_dir' represents a relative path to the directory used for testing the algorithms

If you mess up on the command line input, the program will display a help message
